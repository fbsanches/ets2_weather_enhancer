# 🌧️ ETS2 - Weather Enhancer Mod (More Rain & Clouds)

This mod enhances the weather system in **Euro Truck Simulator 2 (ETS2)** by increasing the frequency of rain, dark clouds, and chances of storms. It makes the environment feel more dynamic, immersive, and realistic—especially during long hauls.

## 📌 Features:
- **More frequent rain** events across the map.
- **Darker and denser clouds**, even on mostly clear days.
- **Increased chance of storms** with longer transitions between weather types.
- Creates a more **immersive and unpredictable driving atmosphere**.

## 🧩 Structure:
Modifies weather-related profiles in `def/climate/climate.sii` to change probabilities of rain, cloudiness, and clear skies.

## 🔧 Compatibility:
- Compatible with **ETS2 version 1.54.x**
- Should work with default maps and most other mods unless they also modify climate settings.

## 💡 Notes:
- This is a lightweight mod — no texture or sound modifications included.
- Intended for players looking for a bit more atmosphere without overhauling the entire weather system.

## 📝 Installation:
1. Download the `.scs` file and place it in your ETS2 `mod` folder.
2. Enable it from the **Mod Manager** in-game.
3. Compatible with existing save games. No new profile needed.
